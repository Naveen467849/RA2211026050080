Create Two LANs: In Cisco Packet Tracer, drag and drop two switches and connect 5 computers to each switch using Ethernet cables.
Assign IP Addresses: Configure static IP addresses for each computer within their respective LAN subnets (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24 for LAN1 and 192.168.2.0/24 for LAN2).
Connect Switches to Router: Connect each switch to separate LAN ports on a router using Ethernet cables.
Configure Router Interfaces: Set up the router with interfaces for each LAN (e.g., FastEthernet0/0 for LAN1 and FastEthernet0/1 for LAN2) and assign IP addresses to each interface.
Enable Routing: Configure routing on the router to allow communication between the two LANs (use static routes or a routing protocol like RIP or OSPF).
Connect Router to WAN: Connect the router’s WAN port to a simulated ISP router or a cloud device.
Configure WAN Interface: Assign an IP address to the router’s WAN interface and configure NAT to allow LANs to access the internet.
Run Simulations: Test connectivity between computers in different LANs using the ping command and verify internet access to ensure proper configuration.
